# Treehouse-06-Content-Scraper

This is my repository for the 6th project for the team treehouse full stack javascript tech degree.

This project is about building a little web scraper that scrapes that prices from http://shirts4mike.com , which is a demo-project for a web shop. 


See [requirements](Documentation/Requirements.md) for the instructions.

The folder "Provided-Files" contains the files provided for the project.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/Notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another.
